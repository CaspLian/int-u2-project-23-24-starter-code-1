    <h1>What are Invasive Species?</h1>
    <p class="p1">Invasive species are species that is introduced to an environment where they become overpopulated and
      harms its new environment. Invasive species can pose a significant threat to native and plant communities,
      adversely affect habitats and bioregions, causing ecological, environmental, and/or economic damage Invasive
      species can lead to the extinction of native plants and animals, destroy biodiversity, and permanently alter
      habitats.

    <h2> How Do They Spread?</h2>
    <p class="p2">
      Invasive species are spread primarily by human activities, often unintended. People, and goods transported, travel
      quickly around the world, and often carry uninvited species with them. Invasive species can be introduced to an
      area by ship ballast water, firewood, accidental release, and by people. Insects can be transported easily in
      wood, shipping palettes, and crates shipped across the globe. Ornamental plans can become invasive after escaping
      in the wild. Released unwanted pets are another way invasive species are spread around the world.

      <h3>Feral Swine (Sus scrofa)</h3>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Other names: Wild or feral boars, hogs or pigs; Eurasian or Russian wild boars</li>
        <li> Originate from: Parts of Europe, Asia and North Africa
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrival: European settlers brought them for food beginning in the 1500s; others brought them for sport hunting in the 1900s
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="sp">
      Impacts: preying on the nests, eggs, and young of ground-nesting birds and the young of larger animals such as deer. They compete with native wildlife for important food sources, displace other animals through aggression and competition, spreads diseases and parasites, destroys crops, and native vegitation

      <h3>Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)</h3>

      <p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Origin: Europe and temperate Asia</li>
          <li>Arrival: Purple loosestrife was introduced to the United States in the early 1800s for ornamental and medicinal uses.</li>
          <li>Native Alternatives: Blazing star (Liatris spicata), American blue vervain (Verbena hastate) and New York ironweed (Vernonia noveboracensis)</li>    
        </ul>
      <p class="sp">
      Impacts: Purple loosestrife can become the dominant plant species in wetlands. One plant can produce as many as 2 million wind-dispersed seeds per year and underground stems grow at a rate of 1 foot per year, displacing native flora, reducing plant diversity until a landscape is no longer able to support longstanding native plant, animal, and insect communities.
