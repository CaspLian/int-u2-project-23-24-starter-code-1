    <h1>What are Invasive Species?</h1>
    <p class="p1">Invasive species are species that is introduced to an environment where they become overpopulated and harms its new environment.

  <h2> How Do They Spread?</h2>
    <p class= "p2">
      Invasive species are spread primarily by human activities, often unintended. People, and goods transported, travel quickly around the world, and often carry uninvited species with them. Invasive species can be introduced to an area by ship ballast water, firewood, accidental release, and by people. Insects can be transported easily in wood, shipping palettes, and crates shipped across the globe. Ornamental plans can become invasive after escaping in the wild. Released unwanted pets are another way invasive species are spread
